                        <h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
                        <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:</p>
                        <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
                        <p>If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>
                        <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
                        <p>We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</p>
                        
                        <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
                        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
                        
                        <h2>6. Policy for Children</h2>
                        <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13.

If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:productivityowen@gmail.com">productivityowen@gmail.com</a></p>

                        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
