            I am completely using 100% HTML and CSS to design this Digital CV. While there are many smart and fast ways to 
            create a webpage and design, I chose the traditional approach. The reason is that I want to show you the effort 
            and dedication I put into building something I love to learn and create. I understand that PDF resumes are also 
            considered old-fashioned, so I created my own Digital Webpage to give you a glimpse of the future of resumes, 
            making it easier for you to view and understand my skills and experiences. And of course! I will update a new 
            design of UI/UX and to approach the other smart Tools and Softwares.
            <br><br>
            I want to showcase my skills through my Digital CV. I will continuously update it because I consider myself the 
            product. I aim to demonstrate and prove my abilities to others, highlighting my knowledge and skills.
            <br><br>
            Creating this Digital CV not only allows me to present my knowledge and experience but also provides a better 
            and easier way for future hiring managers or anyone responsible for hiring to understand my qualifications. 
            This Digital CV is not just for fun; it represents me as the product, showcasing my knowledge, thinking, 
            building, and learning abilities.
